# ngx-midi

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and enhanced with [ng-packagr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-packagr).

## Adjusting template 

- Search and replace `ngx-midi` string with your service name.
- Rename `DemoModule` class and file name with your module name.
- Rename `DemoService` class and file name with your service name.
- Replace boilerplate service code with your implementation.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` or `npm run build:app` to build the test application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/app` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

Run `npm run build` or `npm run build:app` to build the library. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/lib` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Linting

Run `ng lint` to execute `tslint` on library code. Test application and unit tests were deliberately excluded. 

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
